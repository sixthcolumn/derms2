Issue 1 :

61968-5/change/ExecuteDERGroupsOperationSet

In Message.xsd there is a type any:namespace="##other", even though it has minOccurs=0,
it is breaking cxf, in that when any mess:Operation message is used in the request or response
it breaks, stating that ##other is 'required'.

I have commented out the any type in Message.xsd for now
